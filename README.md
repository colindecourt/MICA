# MICA Project

The main purpose of this project is to develop a Matlab application dedicated to cardiologists. This application will be able to display electrocardiograms as well as additional information such as the heart rate or recognized pathologies. Signal processing algorithms are developed to auto- matically compute the heart rate but also to extract features highlighting probable pathologies.

## Folders

There are different folders in this repository, each of these folders contains files specific to the operation of the interface.

### Data

Contains ECGs from different patients (noisy or not). Explanations are in folder PatientECG.


### Document

Initial documents useful for understanding the project. 

### Functions 

Principal functions without interface. 


### Images

Pictures for the interface.

### Rapport 

.tex file of the final report.

### src

Functions for the interface (or not).

## Interface

To run the interface launch the file : 

```
 	MICA_PROJECT_int.fig
```

or

```
 	MICA_PROJECT_int.m
```
